devart
======

code for devart commission, tentatively titled "play the world".  

this should be at the root level of OF (0.8).  It's using OSX specific libraries at the moment, and will contain weird experiments with aubio, libsndfile, vamp, etc.  As we go, we'll start to label and mark things. 


- audio: raw audio files, analysis files, etc
- utils: command line tools such as vamp plugin runner
- noteDetection: experiments in segmentation of notes
- notePlayback: experiments in playing back note files
